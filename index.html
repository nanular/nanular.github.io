				<h2>About Me</h2>

				<p>
					Neil Zimmerman is located north of Austin, in Pflugerville, TX.  He's been married to his highschool sweetheart for 11 years and is a father of an imaginative 6-year-old son and a headstrong 1-year-old baby daughter.  Also.. he feels rather uncomfortable referring to himself in the third person.

					My career has largely consisted of solving problems for people.  At Apple, I handled escalated technical support calls for iOS and iTunes.  Eventually, I took on many other projects, including several months as a backfill in Site Support Engineering.  Here I learned the art of text-based communication while offering written assistance to senior phone advisors when they encountered new or more complex issues.  I really got to indulge in my love for verbose log files during this time.

					I play the guitar and bass guitar.  I love transcribing the songs of other musicians and finding out what processes and methods they used to get to their final product.  When I was younger and time was plentiful, I spent most of my day writing and recording original material.

					I am super excited to be a part of this web development bootcamp.  I've always been interested in computer software and coding.  Now, I will finally have the chance to dive in head first and see what I can do.
